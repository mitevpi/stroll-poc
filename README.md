# Stroll

TT AEC Hackathon 2019 - Seattle

This is an app which helps people find the most nature-filled walks/paths to take thrughout the day in order to stimulate creativity and boost mental health.

Pathfinding is performed via Weighted Graph computation, with weights being given for characteristics such as proximity to parks, and amount of nature in the field of view.

## Proof of Concept

For the proof of concept application, we were not able to complete the functionality of a walk being a "loop", but we do calculate and find the most nature-filled walk given the input parameters and start point.
